LiveCD builder for FuryBSD

## Continuous builds

Continuous builds can be downloaded [here](../../releases/continuous/). __CAUTION:__ These are meant for development only. Use at your own risk. Do not use in production environments.

To minimize the amount of data when going from build to build, `.zsync` files are also provided. [More information](https://askubuntu.com/questions/54241/how-do-i-update-an-iso-with-zsync)

It is also possible to directly download and write straight to a USB stick in one go. __Caution:__ This will OVERWRITE the entire contents of the USB stick.
